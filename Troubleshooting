## Router Troubleshooting:1)First check if the route url is not local #oc get routes
                          2) Check service is working or not Curl <serviceip>:8080 
                          if still now working then issue might be in dns configuration.
                     
Troubleshoot your dns server: Check dns entry - /etc/dnsmasq.d/origin-upstream-dns.conf
Check dns entry - /etc/dnsmasq.conf
Check dns entry - /etc/sysconfig/network-script/ifcfg-eth0
If dns is working properly, then check the node on which router pod is deployed.Check whether it is schedulable or not.

## Failed to push Image to registry
1) Check docker-registry pod is running or not.
 If you delete docker-registry pod to create it once again by replication controler,
   in that case registry ip will also get change, so you need to restart master service as well.
     #systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master.
3) Ensure that route of docker-registry is configured in correct way.
   In case of insecure registry ,there must --insecure-registry 172.30.0.0/16 parameter in option field.
   Restart docker and hopefully it will work.
4) Also check block registry entries.
   
## Pod is in creating state
1) Check: #oc get event ---> There could be an image pullbackoff error.
2) Pod is not able to schedule on node. ---> Check scheduling configuration. # oc get pods -o wide
3) Node ouf o resources. --> Make sure that node would be having enough memory for storing docker images and other resources.
4) SSH on node and try to pull same image manually. ( This will help to troubleshoot)
5) Check docker configuration and docker logs.
  #journalctl -u docker
  # journalct -u --atomic-openshift-node
6) Docker service is important, if it is down, node will also go down.
7)Prun is used to delete old container which are not in used so far. Also delete /var/log/messages

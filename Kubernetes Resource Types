1) Pod : It is a basic unit of work for kubernetes. Pod can have different application container which are relatively tightly coupled.
Each pod is tied to a node where it is scheduled and remains there until termination or deletion. 
In case of node failure, identical pods are scheduled on other available nodes in cluster.
